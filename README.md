  <h1>🧑‍💻 Graph Theory</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> João Pedro Soares</p>

  <h2>📌 Description</h2>
  <p><strong>Graph Theory</strong> is a project that demonstrates the application of graph theory concepts, algorithms, and problems. The project is implemented in various programming languages to help visualize and solve graph-related problems such as shortest path, graph traversal, and connected components.</p>
